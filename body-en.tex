\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:introduction}

Contour can be defined as a object profile or shape. It can be
bidimensional and associate a dimension like height to another like
time. It can be also multidimensional, and associate three or more
dimensions, like height and length to time. In this paper we use only
bidimensional contours. In music contours can be associated to pitch,
density, rhythm, rhythm complexity, orchestral homogeneity, intensity,
etc. Melodic contours are related to pitch movement as function of
time.

Contour study is important because, like motives and pitch sets,
contours can help to give coherence to a musical piece. They represent
handling musical structures through operations like inversion and
retrogradation, and can be aproached by analytical or compositional
points of view.

Despite the possible coherence given by contours and the operations
provided by contour theories, systematic studies of contour operations
and combinations usage in musical composition are scarce. It's
necessary experimentation and studies about this operations usage in
composition area.

In this paper we present a brief review of contour literature, a
contour analytic usage example, and contour applications in
composition. This paper represents a short summary of the
compositional contour applications research now in progress and
described in Sampaio master's thesis \cite{sampaio08:em}.

\section{Contour theories}
\label{sec:contour-theories}

Many authors
\cite{friedmann85:methodology,friedmann87:response,morris87:composition,morris93:directions,marvin.ea87:relating,marvin88:generalized,marvin.ea95:generalization,polansky.ea92:possible,quinn97:fuzzy,clifford95:contour,beard03:contour}
have developed theories to system contour study. These theories were
developed primarily as analytic techniques for non-tonal compositions
without typical musical features used to demonstrate coherence in
tonal compositions, like phrase, periods, themes and functional
analysis \cite{beard03:contour}.

Music analysis under contour point of view have been effective in
tonal and non-tonal music. There are successful analysis of A.
Schoenberg \cite{friedmann85:methodology}, A. Webern
\cite{clifford95:contour}, L. Dallapicolla
\cite{marvin88:generalized}, and W. A. Mozart \cite{beard03:contour}
pieces.

Contour is defined as an ordered distinct elements set, with
repetition or not, upward numbered \cite{morris93:directions}. For
instance, the Beethoven's Fifth Symphony main motive
(fig. \ref{fig:5a-sinfonia-motivo}) has a melodic contour symbolically
represented by (3 1 2 0), and graphically represented by figure
\ref{fig:c-3120}.

\section{Contour in Composition}
\label{sec:contour-composition}

Sampaio master's thesis main result \cite{sampaio08:em} was a
composition based on contours operations combinations.

This piece is based on a six notes motive called $\alpha$
(fig. \ref{fig:motivo-alfa}) and its derived contour P(5 3 4 1 2
0). This motive is based on octatonic scale.

\begin{figure}[!p]
  \centering
  \subfloat[$\alpha$ motive]{
    \includegraphics{motivo-alfa}
    \label{fig:motivo-alfa}
  }
  \subfloat[P(5 3 4 1 2 0) contour]{
    \includegraphics{c-534120}
    \label{fig:c-534120}
  }
  \caption{Materials}
  \label{fig:materials}
\end{figure}

In the piece there is a \eng{fugato}. The subject and countersubject
are based on rotation and retrogradation operations. The subject has
original contour P(5 3 4 1 2 0) and factor 3 rotation
(fig. \ref{fig:sujeito-fugato}). The contoursubject has original
contour retrogradation repeated three times with different rotation
factors---5, 4 and 3 (fig. \ref{fig:contra-sujeito-fugato}).

\begin{figure}
  \centering
  \subfloat[Subject]{
    \includegraphics[scale=3.2]{sujeito-fugato}

  }

  \subfloat[Countersubject]{

    \label{fig:contra-sujeito-fugato}
  }
  \caption{Structural elements of \eng{fugato}}
  \label{fig:elementos-fugato}
\end{figure}

Contours were divided in smaller pieces by interval expanded
interpolated contours. In figure \ref{fig:interpolacao-expansao},
contour Q(0 2 1 4 3 5) has G, B$\flat$ A, C$\sharp$, B$\sharp$ and
D$\sharp$ long notes and is divided in two pieces by the interval
expanded interpolated contour with C$\sharp$, G, E, B$\flat$, G and
C$\sharp$ short notes.

  \centering
  \includegraphics[scale=4.8]{oboe-solo-secao-5}
  \caption{Interpolation and expansion}
  \label{fig:interpolacao-expansao}
\end{figure}

Rotation and interval expansion occur like in figure
\ref{fig:notas-curtas-madeiras}. In flute the contour has original
form, and in clarinet there is a factor 2 rotation and an
expansion. In oboe there is a factor 3 rotation and contour deviation
justified by the gesture. In bassoon there is a factor 3 contour
rotation and retrogradation, and intervallic expansion.

\end{figure}

The second section of the piece has pitch amplitude grown and raised
by P(5 3 4 1 2 0) contour expansion. Notes are choosen in octatonic
scale omitting one note in each three. Figure ilustrates this
process. In G F$\sharp$ E D$\sharp$ C$\sharp$ C$\natural$ B$\flat$ A G
F$\sharp$ E scale the notes F$\sharp$, D$\sharp$, C$\natural$, A, and
F$\sharp$ are ommitted, the remain notes G, E, C$\sharp$, B$\flat$, G,
E, and are kept and ordered in contour resulting G C$\sharp$ E G
B$\flat$ E. This procedure is repeated omitting two adjacent notes in
each four, omitting three adjacent notes in each five and so on.
