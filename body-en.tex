\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:introduction}

Contour can be defined as an object profile or shape. It can be
bidimensional and associate a dimension like height to another like
time. It can be also multidimensional, and associate three or more
dimensions, like height and length to time. In this paper we use only
bidimensional contours. In music, contours can be associated to pitch,
density, rhythm, rhythmic complexity, orchestral homogeneity,
intensity, etc. Melodic contours are related to pitch movement as
function of time. For instance, Beethoven's Fifth Symphony main motive
and its contour are represented respectively in figures
\ref{fig:5a-sinfonia-motivo} and \ref{fig:c-3120}.

\end{figure}

Contour study is important because, like motives and pitch sets,
contours can help to give coherence to a musical piece. They represent
handling musical structures through operations like inversion and
retrogradation, and can be aproached by analytical or compositional
points of view.

Despite the possible coherence given by contours and the operations
provided by contour theories, systematic studies of contour operations
and combinations usage in musical composition are scarce. It's
necessary experimentation and studies about these operations usage in
composition area.

In this paper we present a brief review of contour literature, a
contour analytic usage example, and contour applications in
composition. This paper represents a short summary of the
compositional contour applications research now in progress and
described in first author master's thesis\footnote{The reference was
  omitted to keep anonymity. It will be included in final version.}

\section{Contour theories}
\label{sec:contour-theories}

Many authors
\cite{friedmann85:methodology,friedmann87:response,morris87:composition,morris93:directions,marvin.ea87:relating,marvin88:generalized,marvin.ea95:generalization,polansky.ea92:possible,quinn97:fuzzy,clifford95:contour,beard03:contour}
have developed theories to system the contour study. These theories
were developed primarily as analytic techniques for non-tonal
compositions without typical musical features used to demonstrate
coherence in tonal compositions, like phrase, periods, themes and
functional analysis \cite{beard03:contour}.

These theories provides arrays, matrixes and many operations to help
in comparing contours, like inversion, translation, contour elements
comparison, and contour similarity comparisons, comparison matrix and
contour interval array.

Music analysis under contour point of view have been effective in
tonal and non-tonal music. There are successful analysis of A.
Schoenberg \cite{friedmann85:methodology}, A. Webern
\cite{clifford95:contour}, L. Dallapicolla
\cite{marvin88:generalized}, and W. A. Mozart \cite{beard03:contour}
pieces. Clifford \cite{clifford95:contour}, for example, says contour
has a significant role in Webern pre-serial music structure.

The compositional contour applications research said is based in these
theories. Two short pieces and an eleven minutes woodwind quintet were
composed to experiment contour operations possibilities in composition
(see section \ref{sec:contour-composition}). Also a contour processor
software\footnote{Additional information and link were also omitted to
  keep anonymity.} is been developed as main object of first author
doctor's. This software receives as input symbollic contours and
outputs symbollic and graphical representations of contours and
operations. In future the software will receive as input
Lilypond\footnote{\url{http://lilypond.org/}} format scores and will
have a graphical interface.

\section{Contour in Composition}
\label{sec:contour-composition}

Contour can represent significant structures in compositional process
of a piece, however, studies involving systematic contour usage in
composition are scarce. Hence we began a research in which we composed
contour based experimental pieces.

This research most important result is first author's master's
thesis. In this thesis a woodwind quintet eleven minutes piece was
composed using combinations of contour operations associated with
parameters such as pitch, tempo, density and texture.

This piece is based on a six notes motive called $\alpha$
(fig. \ref{fig:motivo-alfa})---based on octatonic scale---and its
derived contour P(5 3 4 1 2 0) (fig. \ref{fig:c-534120}). This P
contour, its subsets and operations---retrogradation, inversion,
rotation, interpollation---were the only used in the piece.

\begin{figure}[!p]
  \centering
  \subfloat[$\alpha$ motive]{
    \includegraphics{motivo-alfa}
    \label{fig:motivo-alfa}
  }
  \subfloat[P(5 3 4 1 2 0) contour]{
    \includegraphics{c-534120}
    \label{fig:c-534120}
  }
  \caption{Materials}
  \label{fig:materials}
\end{figure}

For instance, the tempo in this piece---82, 66, 120, 108 and
112---have relations based in A(1 0 4 2 3) contour, a five elements P
subset. The number of instruments in piece first section also are
based in a P subset contour, N(1 3 2 5 4). The piece begins with a
solo, then a trio, a duo, a quintet, and finally a quartet.

In the piece there is a \eng{fugato}. The subject and countersubject
are based on rotation and retrogradation operations. The subject has
original contour P(5 3 4 1 2 0) and factor 3 rotation
(fig. \ref{fig:sujeito-fugato}). The contoursubject has original
contour retrogradation repeated three times with different rotation
factors---5, 4 and 3 (fig. \ref{fig:contra-sujeito-fugato}).

\begin{figure}
  \centering
  \subfloat[Subject]{
    \includegraphics[scale=3.2]{sujeito-fugato}

  }

  \subfloat[Countersubject]{

    \label{fig:contra-sujeito-fugato}
  }
  \caption{Structural elements of \eng{fugato}}
  \label{fig:elementos-fugato}
\end{figure}

Contours were divided in smaller pieces by interval expanded
interpolated contours. In figure \ref{fig:interpolacao-expansao},
contour Q(0 2 1 4 3 5) has G, B$\flat$ A, C$\sharp$, B$\sharp$ and
D$\sharp$ long notes and is divided in two pieces by the interval
expanded interpolated contour with C$\sharp$, G, E, B$\flat$, G and
C$\sharp$ short notes.

\begin{figure}[!p]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[scale=4.8]{oboe-solo-secao-5}
  \caption{Interpolation and expansion}
  \label{fig:interpolacao-expansao}
\end{figure}

Rotation and interval expansion occur like in figure
\ref{fig:notas-curtas-madeiras}. In flute the contour has original
form, and in clarinet there is a factor 2 rotation and an
expansion. In oboe there is a factor 3 rotation and contour deviation
justified by the gesture. In bassoon there is a factor 3 contour
rotation and retrogradation, and intervallic expansion.

    \label{fig:rot-3-retr}
  }

  \label{fig:rotacao-expansao}
\end{figure}

The second section of the piece has pitch amplitude grown and raised
by P(5 3 4 1 2 0) contour expansion. Notes are choosen in octatonic
scale omitting one note in each three. Figure ilustrates this
process. In G F$\sharp$ E D$\sharp$ C$\sharp$ C$\natural$ B$\flat$ A G
F$\sharp$ E scale the notes F$\sharp$, D$\sharp$, C$\natural$, A, and
F$\sharp$ are ommitted, the remain notes G, E, C$\sharp$, B$\flat$, G,
E, and are kept and ordered in contour resulting G C$\sharp$ E G
B$\flat$ E. This procedure is repeated omitting two adjacent notes in
each four, omitting three adjacent notes in each five and so on.
